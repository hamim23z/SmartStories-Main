# Smart Stories - Part of The Smart Hub


### Project Recap

Smart Stories is a project I made to develop and highlight my skills using mySQL, API's, and POST. The purpose of this project is for users to
enter their stories, preferably horror and adventurous, and then I will post it on TikTok, YouTube, and even Instagram. Users have the options
of name, location, age, whether or not to stay private, and to enter their actually story. This project was a heavy emphasis on mySQL, connecting
to a database. and being able to handle information.
